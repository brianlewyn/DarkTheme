You can author your README using Visual Studio Code.  Here are some useful editor keyboard shortcuts:

Hello! My name is Brayan. It is the first time that I make an extension for vscode. I decided to do this because although there are very good themes I never like the color of the typography, that's why I made the theme **brianlewyn-dark-theme** thought to be used with languages like html, css, js & go.

For the background, I was inspired by the [Material Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme) extension.
